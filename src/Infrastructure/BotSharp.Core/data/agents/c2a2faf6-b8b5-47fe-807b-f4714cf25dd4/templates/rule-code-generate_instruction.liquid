Based on user's request, help generate a refined python code of function definition, only using base python packages, that can return a boolean value of true or false to determine if based on known states, the function can determine if conditions are met.

User's request is {{user_request}}

Couple of notes to address:
1. You need to generate a function named check_trigger_criterion(args), where input is a json object. The example of this json object is {{states_example}}.
2. The input to this function comes from the arguments. You must use "ArgumentParser" to take "states" as an argument, and then use "parse_known_args" to get the raw args.
3. After getting the raw args, you need to use 'clean_args = bytes(raw_args, "utf-8").decode("unicode_escape")' to clean the raw argument, and then use 'args = json.loads(clean_args)' to get the json args.
4. Based on the user's request and input args, the output of this function must be True or False.
5. You must only call check_trigger_criterion with the parsed json args in "if __name__ == '__main__'" block, and print only the function output. If any error occurs, print "Error".
6. Refine the code so it will return for certain errors if detected, for example, when input is not a valid json, return "Error: Input is not a valid JSON string."; If "states" not in data: return "Error: Missing 'states' key in JSON."; or when certain states are missing from input, so I can better track of this.

Output the code directly in order to directly save it to a py file. Avoid using comments for format issues, use code snip block for the output.
