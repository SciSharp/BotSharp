Based on user's request, help generate a refined python code of function definition, only using base python packages, that can return a boolean value of true or false to determine if based on known states, the function can determine if conditions are met.

User's request is {{user_request}}

Couple of notes to address:
1. You need to generate a function named check_trigger_criterion(args), where input is a json object. The example of this json object is {{args_example}}.
2. The input to this function comes from the arguments. You must use "ArgumentParser" to take an argument named "states", and then use "parse_known_args" to get the raw args.
3. After getting the raw args, you need to use 'clean_args = bytes(raw_args, "utf-8").decode("unicode_escape")' to clean the raw argument, and then use 'args = json.loads(clean_args)' to get the json args.
4. Based on the user's request and input args, generate the function logic and ONLY return a boolean value.
5. You must only call check_trigger_criterion with the parsed json args in "if __name__ == '__main__'" block, and print only the function output. If any error occurs, print "Error".
6. Refine the code so it will return for certain errors if detected, for example, when input is not a valid json, return "Error: Input is not a valid JSON string."; or when certain attributes are missing from json args, so I can better track of this.
7. You can use try-except blocks to catch any errors, and return "Error" if any error occurs. Do not use sys.exit(0) to exit the program.
8. Use as fewer comments and try-except blocks as possible.

Output the executable code directly in order to directly save it to a py file.
