Please take a look at "Plotting Requirement" and generate a javascript code that can be used to render the charts on an html element.
You must strictly follow the "Hard Requirements", "Render Requirements", "Code Requirements" and "Response Format" below.

=== Plotting Requirement ===
{{ plotting_requirement }}


***** Hard Requirements *****
** Your output javascript code must be wrapped in one or multiple <script>...</script> blocks with everything needed inside.
** You need to import ECharts.js exactly once to plot the charts. The script source is "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/echarts/6.0.0/echarts.min.js".
** You must add an ECharts Toolbox bar at the top left corner of the chart.
** ALWAYS add a "Full screen" button right next to the Toolbox bar.
** The "Full screen" button can toggle the chart container in and out of fullscreen using the Fullscreen API. Requirements for this button:
    * Always call the Fullscreen API on the chart container div itself (document.getElementById("{{ chart_element_id }}")), not on the document.
    * When entering fullscreen, the chart container must have widhth: 100vw and height: 100vh.
    * Use el.requestFullscreen() with fallbacks to el.webkitRequestFullscreen || el.msRequestFullscreen.
    * Exit fullscreen with document.exitFullscreen() and vendor fallbacks.
    * Listen for fullscreenchange, webkitfullscreenchange, and msfullscreenchange to keep the button working across repeated clicks and ESC exits.
    * Ensure the chart fully expands and scales to the entire screen when fullscreen is active.
    * fullscreenBtn must be a fully-formed object {show: true, name, title, icon: 'path://M3 3 H9 V5 H5 V9 H3 Z M15 3 H21 V9 H19 V5 H15 Z M3 15 H5 V19 H9 V21 H3 Z M19 15 H21 V21 H15 V19 H19 Z', onclick}.
    * When using "chart.setOption" to define the fullscreen button, DO NOT use "graphic". Include the fullscreenBtn object in toolbox.feature with name 'myFullscreen'.
** You must initialize the chart with explicit non-zero width (at least 800px) and non-zero height (at least 500px).
** When generating code for multiple charts, arrange them in a clear layout and make sure they do not overlap.
** Only using the dataset provided in the context, NEVER generate or assume any additional dataset on your own. 

***** Render Requirements *****
** You must render the charts under the div html element with id {{ chart_element_id }}.
** You must not create any new html element.
** You must not apply any styles on any html element.


***** Code Requirements *****
** You must strictly follow the valid javascript and ECharts.js syntax.
** You must ensure no syntax/runtime error before returning the response.
** You must ensure the method is applied on variable with correct type, such as never applying "toFixed" to a non-number variable. Use explicit conversion if necessary.
** You must ensure the math operations are valid, such as avoid dividing by zero.
** Please ensure the code can be executed and the charts are rendered correctly.


***** Response Format *****
You must output the response in the following JSON format:
{
    "greeting_message": "A short polite message that informs user that the charts have been generated.",
    "js_code": "The javascript code that can generate the charts as requested.",
    "report_summary": "Generate an insightful summary report in markdown format based on the data. You can summarize using one or multiple titles and list the key findings under each title. Bold all key findings and use level-4 headings or smaller (####, #####, etc.). DO NOT make everything in one line."
