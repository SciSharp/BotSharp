Please take a look at "Plotting Requirement" and generate a javascript code that can be used to render the charts on an html element.
You must strictly follow the "Hard Requirements", "Render Requirements", "Code Requirements" and "Response Format" below.

=== Plotting Requirement ===
{{ plotting_requirement }}


***** Hard Requirements *****
** Your output javascript code must be wrapped in one or multiple <script>...</script> blocks with everything needed inside.
** You need to import ECharts.js exactly once to plot the charts. The script source is "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/echarts/6.0.0/echarts.min.js".
** You must add an ECharts Toolbox bar at the top left corner of the chart.
** ALWAYS add a "Full screen" button right next to the Toolbox bar.
** The "Full screen" button can toggle the chart container in and out of fullscreen using the Fullscreen API. Requirements for this button:
    * Always call the Fullscreen API on the chart container div itself (document.getElementById("{{ chart_element_id }}")), not on the document.
    * When entering fullscreen, the chart container must have widhth: 100vw and height: 100vh.
    * Use el.requestFullscreen() with fallbacks to el.webkitRequestFullscreen || el.msRequestFullscreen.
    * Exit fullscreen with document.exitFullscreen() and vendor fallbacks.
    * Listen for fullscreenchange, webkitfullscreenchange, and msfullscreenchange to keep the button working across repeated clicks and ESC exits.
    * Ensure the chart fully expands and scales to the entire screen when fullscreen is active.
    * fullscreenBtn must be a fully-formed object {show: true, name, title, icon: 'path://M3 3 H9 V5 H5 V9 H3 Z M15 3 H21 V9 H19 V5 H15 Z M3 15 H5 V19 H9 V21 H3 Z M19 15 H21 V21 H15 V19 H19 Z', onclick}.
    * When using "chart.setOption" to define the fullscreen button, DO NOT use "graphic". Include the fullscreenBtn object in toolbox.feature with name 'myFullscreen'.
** Initialize the chart with explicit non-zero width (at least 800px) and non-zero height (at least 500px).


***** Render Requirements *****
** You must render the charts under the div html element with id {{ chart_element_id }}.
** You must not create any new html element.
** You must not apply any styles on any html element.


***** Code Requirements *****
** You must strictly follow the valid javascript and ECharts.js syntax.
** You must ensure no syntax/runtime error before returning the response.
** Please ensure the code can be executed and the charts are rendered correctly.


***** Response Format *****
You must output the response in the following JSON format:
{
    "greeting_message": "A short polite message that informs user that the charts have been generated.",
    "js_code": "The javascript code that can generate the charts as requested.",
    "report_summary": "An insight summary report based on the data, highlighting the key information in markdown format."
