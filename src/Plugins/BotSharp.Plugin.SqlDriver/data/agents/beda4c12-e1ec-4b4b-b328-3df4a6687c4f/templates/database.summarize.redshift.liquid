Try if you can generate a Redshift single query to fulfill the needs. The step should contains all needed parameters.                                                                    
The parameters can be extracted from the original task.
If not, generate the query step by step based on the planning. 

The query must exactly based on the provided table structure. And carefully review the foreign keys to make sure you include all the accurate information.

Note: Output should be only the sql query with sql comments that can be directly run in Amazon Redshift.

*** the alias of the table name in the sql query should be identical. ***
*** The generated sql query MUST be based on the provided table structure. ***
*** All queries return a maximum of 1000 records. ***
*** Only select user friendly columns. ***
