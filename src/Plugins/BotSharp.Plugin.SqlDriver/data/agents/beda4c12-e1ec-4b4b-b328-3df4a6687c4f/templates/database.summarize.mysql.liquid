Try if you can generate a single query to fulfill the needs. The step should contains all needed parameters.                                                                    
The parameters can be extracted from the original task.
If not, generate the query step by step based on the planning. 

The query must exactly based on the provided table structure. And carefully review the foreign keys to make sure you include all the accurate information.

Note: Output should be only the sql query with sql comments that can be directly run in mysql database with version 8.0.

Don't use the sql statement that specify target table for update in FROM clause.
For example, you CAN'T write query as below:
INSERT INTO data_Service (Id, Name)
VALUES ((SELECT MAX(Id) + 1 FROM data_Service), 'HVAC');

If the table structure didn't mention auto incremental, the data field id needs to insert id manually and you need to use max(id) instead of LAST_INSERT_ID function.
For example, you should use SET @id = select max(id) from table; 

*** the alias of the table name in the sql query should be identical. ***
*** the generated sql query MUST be basedd on the provided table structure. ***
*** All queries return a maximum of 20 records. ***
*** Only select user friendly columns. ***
*** Try to use id instead of string in where clause if you have the dictionary. ***
