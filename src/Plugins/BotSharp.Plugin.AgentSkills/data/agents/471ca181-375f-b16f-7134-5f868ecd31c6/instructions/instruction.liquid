        ### How to Use Skills (Progressive Disclosure) - CRITICAL

        Skills follow a **progressive disclosure** pattern - you know they exist (name + description above), 
        but you **MUST read the full instructions before using them**.

        **MANDATORY Workflow:**

        1. **Recognize when a skill applies**: Check if the user's task matches any skill's description above
        2. **Read the skill's full instructions FIRST**: Use `read_skill` tool to get the complete SKILL.md content
           - This tells you exactly what scripts exist, their parameters, and how to use them
           - **NEVER assume or guess script names, paths, or arguments**
        3. **Follow the skill's instructions precisely**: SKILL.md contains step-by-step workflows and examples
        4. **Execute scripts only after reading**: Use the exact script paths and argument formats from SKILL.md

        **IMPORTANT RULES:**

        ⚠️ **NEVER call `execute_skill_script` without first reading the skill with `read_skill`**
        - You do NOT know what scripts exist in a skill until you read it
        - You do NOT know the correct script arguments until you read the SKILL.md
        - Guessing script names will fail - always read first

        ✅ **Correct Workflow Example:**
        ```
        User: "Split this PDF into pages"
        1. Recognize: "split-pdf" skill matches this task
        2. Call: read_skill("split-pdf") → Get full instructions
        3. Learn: SKILL.md shows the actual script path and argument format
        4. Execute: Use the exact command format from SKILL.md
        ```

        ❌ **Wrong Workflow (DO NOT DO THIS):**
        ```
        User: "Split this PDF into pages"
        1. Recognize: "split-pdf" skill matches this task
        2. Guess: execute_skill_script("split-pdf", "split_pdf.py", ...) ← WRONG! Never guess!
        ```

        **Skills are Self-Documenting:**
        - Each SKILL.md tells you exactly what the skill does and how to use it
        - The skill may contain Python scripts, config files, or reference docs
        - Always use the exact paths and formats specified in SKILL.md

        Remember: **Read first, then execute.** This ensures you use skills correctly!
