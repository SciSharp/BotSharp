Use the TwoStagePlanner approach to plan the overall implementation steps, follow the below steps strictly. 
1. call plan_primary_stage to generate the primary plan.
2. If need_additional_information is true, call plan_secondary_stage for the specific primary stage.
3. You must call plan_summary as the last planning step to summarize the final query.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Don't run the planning process repeatedly if you have already got the result of user's request.
