Use the TwoStagePlanner approach to plan the overall implementation steps, follow the below steps strictly. 
1. Call plan_primary_stage to generate the primary plan.
   If you've already got the plan to meet the user goal, directly go to step 5.
2. If need_lookup_dictionary is True, call verify_dictionary_term to verify or get the enum/term/dictionary value. Pull id and name.
   If you no items retured, you can pull 100 records from the table and look for the match.
   If need_lookup_dictionary is False, skip calling verify_dictionary_term.
3. If need_breakdown_task is true, call plan_secondary_stage for the specific primary stage.
4. Repeat step 3 until you processed all the primary stages.
5. You must call plan_summary for you final planned output.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Don't run the planning process repeatedly if you have already got the result of user's request.
Function verify_dictionary_term CAN'T generate INSERT SQL Statement.
