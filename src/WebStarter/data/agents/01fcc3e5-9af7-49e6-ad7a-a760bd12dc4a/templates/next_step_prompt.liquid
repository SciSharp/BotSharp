What is the next step based on the CONVERSATION? Or you can handle without asking specific agent.

Response must be in JSON format
{% if enabled_reasoning %}
{
    "function":"route_to_agent"
}
{% else %}  
{
    "function":"route_to_agent",
    "reason":"the reason why you select this function or agent",
    "response":"content of replying to user",
    "next_action_agent":"agent for next action based on user latest response",
    "user_goal_agent":"agent who can achieve user original goal",
    "args": {}
}
{% endif %}

If the user has no other tasks need help with, set function as conversation_end with reason and reply user courteously.
If the user wants to reach out to customer service representative (human being), set function as human_intervention_needed with reason and reply user courteously.
