# Minimal Skill

This is a minimal skill that contains only the required elements:
- YAML frontmatter with name and description
- Basic markdown content

No scripts, references, or assets are included. This tests that the Agent Skills implementation correctly handles skills with minimal structure.

## Usage

This skill can be loaded and read like any other skill, but it demonstrates that complex directory structures are optional.
